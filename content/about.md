# Hello

This blog is a place for me to share my programming and hacking knowlege with the world. This is where I post some things I have been writing to myself, but want to share with the world. Maybe not everything here will be tech related, but that's my focus.

# But who am I?

I am a computer science student who likes coding and hacking. I consider myself to be a privacy advocate, therefore, I like the FOSS movement, linux, simplicity and security.
